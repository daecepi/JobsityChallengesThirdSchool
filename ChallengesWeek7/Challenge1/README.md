### Jobsity bookshelf week 6

## Installation
- Backend
- 1. Enter the folder "book-shelf-backend" made in NestJS
- 2. run "npm install"
- 3. The backend on its own contains a README that contains the instruction for the backend setup

- Frontend
- 1. Enter the folder "frontend" project created by create-react-app
- 2. run "npm install"
- 3. Follow its own README.md instructions

## Comments
- Both projects are ready to run in parallel (as this last weeks) after following the readme
- IMPORTANT: for this week is planned a huge styling improvement (because of requirements of last week was not possible to take care of new html functions styling entirely)
- IMPORTANT: other filter not appearing in the requirements for the weeks like layout dinamic handling were left as extras (for this or next week to be implemented)

## Missing
- The point of implementing the reservation form with the DatePicker, part of the component exists (but the implementation will be available during the day in next week's project)
